    Welcome to my personal academic website. I am **Tsung-Yiou Hsieh**, an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Spears School of Business, Oklahoma State University. I am an empirical modeler who is passionate about using quantitative methods to tackle intriguing and managerially relevant questions from observational data. My research aims to quantify the causal effects of marketing decisions across a broad spectrum of outcome metrics to inform and enhance marketing strategies by applying or developing novel quantitative methodologies. My substantive interests lie in marketing analytics, digital marketing, and customer relationship management (CRM). Methodologically, I focus on causal inference, econometrics, and machine learning.
    
    I hold a Ph.D. in Marketing from the C.T. Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston and previously worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the D'Amore-McKim School of Business, Northeastern University. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a master's degree in business analytics from the University of California San Diego and a B.S. in finance from National Chengchi University.
